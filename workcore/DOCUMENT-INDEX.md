# WorkCore Document Corpus Index

This index covers the WorkCore product, extension and MagicAI integration documentation currently maintained on `main`.

Use [`document-index.json`](./document-index.json) for the earlier machine-readable corpus snapshot and [`conversation-engine-corpus-map.md`](./conversation-engine-corpus-map.md) for the consolidated conversation-system analysis.

> **Current integration authority:** Scans 15–21 combine the actual `Masterleeaus/workcore-extensions` packages with the supplied MagicAI 11 host. Scan 21 uses current WorkCore `main` commit `64d05e1a7a1071bf61c1f252d359fbd712da39f5` and supersedes stale open-defect statements in Scans 13, 18 and 20 where explicitly identified. Scans 01–14 remain component evidence and historical analysis.

## Maintenance rules

1. Add every new Markdown document here.
2. Use repository paths as stable identifiers.
3. Preserve timestamped scans and use reconciliation documents to supersede outdated implementation claims.
4. Every future integration scan must inspect MagicAI, the relevant WorkCore extension and the adapter boundary.
5. Record cross-document conflicts explicitly.
6. When WorkCore `main` changes materially, later current-main scans supersede stale open-defect statements in older commit-pinned reports.
7. Re-run the corpus index after major product, integration or shared-engine additions.
